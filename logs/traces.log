A string is a sequence of symbols or characters that can store human-readable or machine-readable data.\n\n\n---\nSTRING\nThe STRING database contains information from numerous sources, including experimental data, computational prediction methods and public text collections. It is ...\n\n\n---\nSTRING: functional protein association networks\nSearch for any pathway name and visualize its proteins as a STRING network. You can query any identifier or a keyword matching, among others, Gene Ontology terms, KEGG pathways, and diseases, but also published manuscripts that may discuss groups of genes.\n\n\n---\nString - JavaScript | MDN - MDN Web Docs Code sample\nThe String object is used to represent and manipulate a sequence of characters. See full list on developer.mozilla.org Strings are useful for holding data that can be represented in text form. Some of the most-used operations on strings are to check their length, to build and concatenate them using the + and += string operators, checking for the existence or location of substrings with the indexOf() method, or extracting substrings with the substring() method. See full list on developer.mozilla.org String () Creates a new String object. It performs type conversion when called as a function, rather than as a constructor , which is usually more useful. See full list on developer.mozilla.org String .fromCharCode() Returns a string created by using the specified sequence of Unicode values. String .fromCodePoint() Returns a string created by using the specified sequence of code points. String .raw() Returns a string created from a raw template string . See full list on developer.mozilla.org These properties are defined on String .prototype and shared by all String instances. String .prototype. constructor The constructor function that created the instance object. For String instances, the initial value is the String constructor . These properties are own properties of each String instance. length Reflects the length of the string . Read-only. See full list on developer.mozilla.org String .prototype.at() Returns the character (exactly one UTF-16 code unit) at the specified index. Accepts negative integers, which count back from the last string character. String .prototype.charAt() Returns the character (exactly one UTF-16 code unit) at the specified index. String .prototype.charCodeAt() Returns a number that is the UTF-16 code unit value at the given index. See full list on developer.mozilla.org String conversion The String () function is a more reliable way of converting values to strings than calling the toString() method of the value, as the former works when used on null and undefined.
